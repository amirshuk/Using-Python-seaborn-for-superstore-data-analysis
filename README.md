# Using-Python-seaborn-for-superstore-data-analysis

summary:
this project mainly focusing on my visualization skills using python seaborn
i did not do the data cleaning first because i would like to compare before and after data cleaning data visualization. 
data cleaning process (objective number 7) is very simple. i just find the lower and upper fence and not selecting data outside of it. 
because it is an outlier.


objectives:
1. investigate most profitable segment and see them in different region
2. drill in to know which sub-category product gives us most profit
3. find average of sales between region (bar chart)
4. find average sales and profit through out the years (line chart)
5. distribution of sales and profit 
6. find outliers 
7. data cleaning
8. sales vs profit (scatter plot)
9. effects type of shipment to sales and profit (stacked bar chart)
10. sales and profit based on segment (pie chart)
11. sales vs segment (treemap)
